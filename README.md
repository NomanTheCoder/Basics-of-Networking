# Basics-of-Networking
<h4>What is Networking?</h4>
<p>Computer Networking:This is the connection of two or more computers to share resources and data. These connections can be wired or wireless, and they allow devices to communicate with each other. Networks can be small and local, like a home network connecting a few devices, or large and global, like the internet.</p>

# Types of Networking
<P>There are different types of networks depending on their size and purpose. Here's a breakdown of the most common ones:

Local Area Network (LAN):This is a network that connects devices in a limited geographical area, like a home, school, or office building. LANs are typically high-speed and secure, and they're used for sharing resources like printers, files, and internet access.

Wide Area Network (WAN):WANs span a much larger geographical distance than LANs,  often connecting multiple LANs over long distances. They can cover entire cities, states, or even countries. WANs are used to connect businesses, government agencies, and other organizations that need to communicate over long distances.
